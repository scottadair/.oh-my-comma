# Contributing
This is a project that will benefit greatly from mass-collaberation, and is somewhat unique in that most users of comma.ai are tech-saavy enough to make a pull request.
Please try to keep your contributions to the core of this repository generic for neos/openpilot, but plugins for .oh-my-comma can be tailored for specific forks if you'd like. (could be cool to see a kegman configuration tool, for example)
Check out the projects and issues on this repo! Feel free to contribute your own ideas as issues, and tag them with labels and projects.

## Pull Requests
Ensure that it works locally if possible. I will validate PRs, and make changes to your PRs in the 'devel' branch, if need be. 
I will squash and merge all PRs to keep the git log down.
